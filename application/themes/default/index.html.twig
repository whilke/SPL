        <hr>
         <p>Strife Beta Series One is now open for registration. If you have a team already in the system, just edit your
         team profile and sign up for the very first SPL run series. If you don't have a team signed up yet, you have six days to
         get one put together, so start calling your friends.</p>
         <p>This is going to be a bit of a mad first series, as there looks to be a lot of new teams in the scene, and we will surely
         run into a few stumbling blocks along the way. All I can ask is that you trust that we will resolve issues as quickly as possibly,
         and do our very best in making this a challenging and fun adventure for every team out there.</p>
         <p>Registration for the Strife Beta Series One will close on <strong>5/18/2014 00:00:00 GMT</strong></p>
